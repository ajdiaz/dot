Dotfiles repository
===================

To create dot files, just run

  ./pre-commit-hook

If you wanto to run the script on every commit into the repo, then copy the
hook to the git hook's directory:

  cp pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit

The `config' directory has special treatment, and is never copied to home
directory or linked, instead the inside directories are linked into
~/.config directory, which must be exists before.

ZSH Helpers
===========

There are a number of useful helpers for zsh, in particular the following
ones:

- vz: create and manage python virtualenvs (`vz help` for more info)
- sc: create and manage script console records (`sc help` for more info)
- vm: create and manage ephemeral containers of the current system.
- vmi: convert vm containers in images to persistent changes
- iam: manage multiple identities in the same HOME, replacing files if
       necessary.
