Dotfiles repository
===================

To create dot files, just run

  ./pre-commit-hook

If you wanto to run the script on every commit into the repo, then copy the
hook to the git hook's directory:

  cp pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit

The `config' directory has special treatment, and is never copied to home
directory or linked, instead the inside directories are linked into
~/.config directory, which must be exists before.
